      <h2>
        Out with the bad! In with the good!
      </h2>

      Look, we get it. We’ve been there ourselves. We understand the problem you’re having, & why you want pesticides. We make the finest pesticides, & we are proud to guarantee that ours will work just like you want them to work.

      <h3>
        Too Many Bad Bugs
      </h3>

      <p>
        We target ladybugs, because those eat the insects we want to protect. Worse, ladybugs aren’t that tasty (just ask Earl). So ladybugs have to GO. Some of the other bad bugs we target with our pesticides include:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>Ants</li>
        <li>Centipedes</li>
        <li>Scorpions</li>
        <li>Lizards</li>
        <li>Monkeys</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        We have a little slogan we use around our company: “If you find a dead monkey in your yard, you can thank Herbert West Landscaping!”
      </p>

      <p>
        So yes, we get rid of the bad bugs. Why? Because like us, you face an even bigger problem…
      </p>

      <h3>
        Not Enough Giant Spiders
      </h3>

      <p>
        That’s right — you want more giant spiders around your home. And we get that! We completely support that goal, so we are happy to use our pesticides to kill the insects (& other creatures) that eat spiders. We want spiders to thrive & live!
      </p>

      <p>
        But our pesticides don’t just kill things that kill spiders. Oh no! They also contain our own very special spider growth serums to make your spiders grow & grow & GROW! Pretty soon the neighbors you have left will be in complete awe of the giant arachnids you have roaming around your property. You will be the talk of the neighborhood, the town, & eventually, as your new spider friends journey off to other locations, the nation & maybe even… the world!
      </p>

      <p>
        Here are two of our success stories.

        We’d encourage you to chat with Steve, the man in the next photo, but no one answers his phone when we call. We’ll try again next week.

        Note: Giant spider side effects may include a loss of mail delivery, pets, & small children. Giant spider webs may damage the paint on cars, tricycles, & other vehicles. Never try to grow giant spiders if you already have giant spider wasps in the area.
